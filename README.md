# Issues

* When using the time tracker LEGACY, exceeds rate limit
* When using the time tracker 2.0, does not return all of the assignees at once so you need to pass each of them manualy. Func made for this but still does not get ALL of them
* Missing tasks compared to the ones in time tracker 2.0 request
